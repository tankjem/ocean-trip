<h3>WELCOME TO OCEAN-TRIP</h3>
 <p>An ocean is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word sea is often used interchangeably with "ocean" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.

Saline water covers approximately 72% of the planet's surface (~3.6Ã—108 km2) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere. The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 5% of the World Ocean has been explored. The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi)with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft).</p>
<p>Oceans are by far the largest animal habitat on earth. The oceans are so huge it is hard for scientists to explore them. Information on ocean animals is not as complete as information on land animals. It is known that animal life can be found at all depths of the ocean, from the surface to the deepest trenches that are over seven miles below the surface.
Some ocean animals spend most of their life in the waters near the land. Others live most of their life in the deeper open sea. Even though the open sea is the largest habitat, it is estimated that only five percent of the world's animal species live there. </p>
